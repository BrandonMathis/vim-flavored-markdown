Vim-Flavored-Markdown
=====================

Markdown + extensions syntax highlighting for vim

a syntax plugin that extends the Tim Pope's markdown syntax file to recognize
github code blocks like:

    ```yourLanguage
    Some code
    ```

It also colors `markdownCode` blocks and in-lines as String, so they are more
easily differentiable in your code.

In the future, I hope to also add some of the phpMarkdown extended syntax as
well (e.g. tables, etc), but for now, I am satisfied to just fix the syntax
highlihting for those blocks.
